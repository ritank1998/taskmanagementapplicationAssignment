# create flowbite-svelte application

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create flowbite-svelte`](https://flowbite-svelte.com/docs/pages/introduction).

## Creating a project
If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project
npm create-svelte@latest --myapp
cd myapp
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
# install and configure the current directory
clone the current project repository
npm install
npm run dev
## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
